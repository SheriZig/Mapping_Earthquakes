# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview 
The scope of this project is to present earthquake data retrieved from the United State Geological Survey (USGS) site on a map in a visually appealing manner. After the data was collected it was added to the map in the shape of circles with the size of the circle indicating the magnitude of the earthquake. A secondary visual was added using the color of the circle to also represent the magnitude of the earthquake. 

In addition to displaying all of the earthquake data, layers were added containing the Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes (magnitude > 4.5). Basemap layers contained three different backgrounds for the map. The first basemap layer contains the street layer, the second layer provides a satellite view of the map and the third layer is a darker background for the map. 

The following steps were used for the project: 

- Create a basic map using Leaflet
- Retrieve data from the United States Geological Survey site
- Use JavaScript geoJSON to create the visualization on the map
- Create a legend to indicate the magnitude based on color
- Create multiple data layers: Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, Major earthquakes
- Create multiple base map layers: Streets, Satellite, Dark View
